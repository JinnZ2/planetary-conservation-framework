CONSEQUENCE VELOCITY ENGINE

The missing variable in every institutional model.

Core principle (Kavik): Consequence doesn't sit still when deferred.
It compounds. It couples with other deferred consequences.
It phase-shifts into something you can't price because it's
no longer the original consequence — it's the consequence
of trying to avoid the consequence.

English says: "The truck is red." (fixed state, permanent property)
Ojibwe says:  "The truck is in a state of redness." (process, temporal, headed somewhere)

Institutional models freeze consequence as a fixed future cost.
This engine models consequence as a PROCESS with velocity,
acceleration, coupling, and phase transition.

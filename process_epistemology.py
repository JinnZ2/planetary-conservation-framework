PROCESS EPISTEMOLOGY ENGINE

State-based vs Process-based knowledge frameworks.

Core insight (Kavik):
English:  "The truck is red."     -> fixed property of object
Ojibwe:   "The truck is redding." -> temporal process, headed somewhere

This is not a linguistic curiosity. It is an epistemological framework
that determines whether your models can see change coming.

Every institutional model that fails does so because it treats
dynamic processes as fixed states. This engine makes that
failure mechanism explicit and measurable.

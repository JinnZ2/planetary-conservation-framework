BUFFER-SENSOR CORRUPTION DETECTOR

Models how incentive structures corrupt sensor networks.

Core principle (Kavik): A sensor incentivized to report stability
will report stability until catastrophic failure. The incentive
structure IS the corruption mechanism.

Topology:
GROUND TRUTH -> SENSOR -> [incentive filter] -> REPORTED STATE

When incentive = "report accurately":  REPORTED ≈ ACTUAL
When incentive = "report stability":   REPORTED = COMFORT until CASCADE
